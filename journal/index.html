                From this article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">"Best practices for     
                form design"</a> the author talks about 20 best practices in order to booster a form's usability. There were two
                form design ideas that stood out to me. The first one talks about how placeholder text of the hint should be place 
                at the bottom of the input box instead of placing it in the box. If it was place in the input box the hint will 
                disappear and if the user forget the hint, they need to clear the text to see it again. The second one that stood
                out to me is auto-focus the first input field. By doing so, it can give the users a starting point which minimizes
                confusion and one tap/click. Also, there should a bold border or a shadow on the active input field in order to make 
                sure the users understand where to focus on.

                A form that demonstrate these two practices is the sign up form from <a href="https://twitter.com/i/flow/signup">Twitter/X</a>. When the page is loaded there is auto-focus for the first input on the name. Also there is a placeholder hint texts inside of
                the input box but when the user click on the box the hint does not disappear but rather get moved up.
