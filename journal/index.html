            <h3><date>February 8, 2024</date></h3> <hr id="h1"><br>


            <p id ="paragraph1">

                The assigned article <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">"here"</a> talks about differnts ways of teaching close reading and visual thinking skills through showing photo image examples. Some points that stood out to me is to question and ask "what is going on in this picture" as way to find details to defend their interpretation of each photos. Also the three simple questions of V.T.S.â€™s facilitation method asking the viewer on what is going on this daigram/chapter, what details/evidence is presented, and where to find more texts can help in close reading any texts in any situation. 


                <br><br>
                An example of this can be seen from this website <a href ="https://www.fishingthefeed.com/">"Fishing the feed"</a> it does an excellent job in using images, animation, and words as a way for the readers to see and think critically of what the message is trying to says, which in this case is about the harmful effect of overfishing. On the right side of the website it has ocean depth meter where as you scroll down it goes in detail of the harmful effect of overfishing and each depth level it shows bolded words, animation, and images for the veiwer to think critically of the issue. On some of the pages there are interactions where the viewer are able to click and an image will pop up showing what the section is talking about. For example one section it has a text in bold that tittle "The ocean is being stripped bare, threating marine life by destabilising food webs..." then on the side the veiwer is able to click and a image of that will show. By doing this the viewer are able to see a real life example of this problem in a form of an image resulting in them thinking of this problem making it impactful and maybe second thoughts.<br><br>

                This article <a href ="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">"Best Practices for 
                Modals/Overlay/Dialog Windows"</a> talks how a modal window is popup/element that sits on top of the main window. The author listed few keypoints on the usage of it and they are to grab the user's attention, get the user's input, show additional information in context, and show information not in context. In order to make sure the modal is used in the right way the listed how their should a escape button, descriptive title,  button label, sizing of the modal, focus by darken the background, and user initiate.

        
                <br><br>
                
                At the end the author talks about the good and bad side of the use of modal and I also agree with her. While using modal to get the user's attention and simplifying the ui are nice and all but the sudden interruption to the user and hiding the main page behind might cause annoyance.<br><br>

            <h3><date>January 25, 2024</date></h3> <hr id="h1"><br>


            <p id ="paragraph1">
                
                From this article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">"Best practices for     
                form design"</a> the author talks about 20 best practices in order to booster a form's usability. There were two
                form design ideas that stood out to me. The first one talks about how placeholder text of the hint should be place 
                at the bottom of the input box instead of placing it in the box. If it was place in the input box the hint will 
                disappear and if the user forget the hint, they need to clear the text to see it again. The second one that stood
                out to me is auto-focus the first input field. By doing so, it can give the users a starting point which minimizes
                confusion and one tap/click. Also, there should a bold border or a shadow on the active input field in order to make 
                sure the users understand where to focus on. 
                
                <br><br>

                A form that demonstrate these two practices is the sign up form from <a href="https://twitter.com/i/flow/signup">Twitter/X</a>. When the page is loaded there is auto-focus for the first input on the name. Also there is a placeholder hint texts inside of
                the input box but when the user click on the box the hint does not disappear but rather get moved up.
