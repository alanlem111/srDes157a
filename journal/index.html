                This article <a href ="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">"Best Practices for 
                Modals/Overlay/Dialog Windows"</a> talks how a modal window is popup/element that sits on top of the main window. The author listed few keypoints on the usage of it and they are to grab the user's attention, get the user's input, show additional information in context, and show information not in context. In order to make sure the modal is used in the right way the listed how their should a escape button, descriptive title,  button label, sizing of the modal, focus by darken the background, and user initiate.

        
            
                <br><br>
                
                At the end the author talks about the good and bad side of the use of modal and I also agree with her. While using modal to get the user's attention and simplifying the ui are nice and all but the sudden interruption to the user and hiding the main page behind might cause annoyance.<br><br>

                From this article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">"Best practices for     
                form design"</a> the author talks about 20 best practices in order to booster a form's usability. There were two
                form design ideas that stood out to me. The first one talks about how placeholder text of the hint should be place 
                at the bottom of the input box instead of placing it in the box. If it was place in the input box the hint will 
                disappear and if the user forget the hint, they need to clear the text to see it again. The second one that stood
                out to me is auto-focus the first input field. By doing so, it can give the users a starting point which minimizes
                confusion and one tap/click. Also, there should a bold border or a shadow on the active input field in order to make 
                sure the users understand where to focus on. 
                
                <br><br>

                A form that demonstrate these two practices is the sign up form from <a href="https://twitter.com/i/flow/signup">Twitter/X</a>. When the page is loaded there is auto-focus for the first input on the name. Also there is a placeholder hint texts inside of
                the input box but when the user click on the box the hint does not disappear but rather get moved up.
