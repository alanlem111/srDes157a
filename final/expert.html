                The first person that review my recent design is a professor that teaches des016. She is qualify to review becuase she deals with graphic design and she worked in the industry before coming to teach. The second person is a professfor from des115 class that I'm taking this quarter. She also qualify because she also was working in the industry as senior graphic deisgner for differnt companies before teaching des115 that deals with typography hierarchy.<br><br>


                Both of the professfors like the design of the waves and the idea of making it animate as a way to page to bring it life. There were few things I got suggested from them both. The first thing is change the font of the title because right it seems too blocky and does not fit the narrative and also the color of the font is bit hard to read. Another thing was suggested is the layout of the page. One of them advise me to layout all the picture out as a form of picture gallary, add a border on artworks in art museum, remove the back and next button, and just add a when click to the image it will overlay and expand the image to the screen. The other prossfor suggested to try out a 2 x 2 image picture gallary on the right with spaces bewteen each images so they are not touching each other. Then expand the tittle size and put it on the left side. I was also advise to darken the background more rather than being bright as of now.
