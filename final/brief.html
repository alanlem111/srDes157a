            <p>
                For my final project I am thinking of improving studio 2 every picture project and the reason I pick project 2 is because
                the overl design does pretty basic and also the overal function pretty basic.

                Out of three the major aspect I am focusing on is the visual design of the project 2. I plan to make the background image
                more detail by animating the waves. Also I am planning to add some sort of a border like those art pieces found in museums. 
                For the functionality I planning remove the text on the bottom of each image and put it inside the image so when the user click or hover the image the text will show up. Then for the usbility I planning on moving some of the buttom location and the maybe put all the picture on the page rather than just one image.
